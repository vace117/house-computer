Description: 
            #[Porcupine](https://github.com/Picovoice/porcupine).   
        
            It supports Linux (x86_64), Mac, Raspberry Pi (Zero, 1, 2, 3, 4), and BeagleBone.
        
            ## Installation
        
            ```bash
            pip install pvporcupine
            ```
        
            If it fails to install PyAudio, you can do the following for Debian/Ubuntu as referenced in the installation guide
            of [PyAudio](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/). 
        
            Install PyAudio  
        
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install python-pyaudio python3-pyaudio
            ```
        
            If the above fails then first run the following
        
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev
            sudo apt-get install python-all-dev python3-all-dev
            ```
        
            ## Usage
        
            ### Realtime Demo
        
            Make sure you have a working microphone connected to your device first. From commandline type the following
        
            ```bash
            pvporcupine_mic --keywords picovoice
            ```
        
            Then say 'picovoice'. The demo processes audio steam from microphone in realtime and detects utterances of 'picovoice'
        
            ### File-Based Demo
        
            ```bash
            pvporcupine_file --input_audio_file_path ${INPUT_AUDIO_FILE_PATH} --keywords bumblebee
            ```
        
            Replace `${INPUT_AUDIO_FILE_PATH}` with a valid path to an audio file (e.g. WAV or FLAC). The demo scans the file
            for occurrences of 'bumblebee'.
        
            In order to get more information about using demos, run them with '--help' argument or look into their GitHub page
            [here](https://github.com/Picovoice/porcupine/tree/master/demo/python).
        
            ### Porcupine Class
            
            You can create an instance of Porcupine engine for use within your application using the factory method provided below
        
            ```python
            import pvporcupine
        
            pvporcupine.create(keywords=pvporcupine.KEYWORDS)
            ```
        
            `pvporcupine.KEYWORDS` is the set of default keyword files that ships with the PIP package across all platforms. In
            order to use your own keyword file you can instantiate the object as follows:
        
            ```python
            import pvporcupine
        
            keyword_file_1_path = ...
            keyword_file_2_path = ...
            keyword_file_3_path = ...
        
            pvporcupine.create(keyword_file_paths=[keyword_file_1_path, keyword_file_2_path, keyword_file_3_path])
            ```
